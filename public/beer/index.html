    <p>I&rsquo;ve been brewing my own beer and mead for almost 15 years now. It has been a really enjoyable hobby and one that allows me to show a bit of my creative side. Here are a few of the recipes that I have devised and brewed over the years - a nice variety of common styles and some really out there ideas and flavors. All recipes are for a 5 gallon batch size.</p>
<p><a href="recipes/hot-pants-jalapeno-pepper" >Hot Pants</a> - A pale ale made with jalapeno peppers and cilantro! Play with the spice level by adding or removing peppers.</p>
<p><a href="recipes/czech-pilsner" >Czech Pilsner</a> - A traditional Czech Pislner, brewed the traditional way, with multiple decoctions.</p>
<p><a href="recipes/prickly-pear-sour" >Prickly Pear Sour</a> - A refreshing sour with the wonderful taste of prickly pear fruit. The color on this one is amazing!</p>
<p><a href="recipes/porter" >Porter</a> - A really solid porter and one that takes additional flavor profiles on well such as vanilla, chocolate, or peanut butter.</p>
<p><a href="recipes/peanut-butter-jelly-time" >Peanut Butter Jelly Time!</a> - I&rsquo;ll admit that this one is a bit out there! I wanted a beer that reminded me of my favorite sandwich and came up with this. Reviews have been understandably mixed - people either really love it or they really hate it.</p>
<p><a href="recipes/gose" >Gose</a> - A solid Gose recipe that is easy to tweak to your desired sour and saltiness.</p>
<p><a href="recipes/czech-dark-lager" >Dark Czech Pilsner</a> - A traditional Dark Czech Pislner, brewed the traditional way, with multiple decoctions. This is one of my absolute favorites!</p>
<p><a href="recipes/brown" >Brown Ale</a> - This brown ale is part of my regular rotation and is absolute crowd pleaser!</p>
<p><a href="recipes/black-lager" >Black Lager</a> - This schwarzbier is smooth and goes down easy. The perfect beer for for those crisp fall and spring nights!</p>
<p><a href="recipes/blonde" >Blonde Ale</a> - This blonde is an easy drinker - perfect for a showerbeer after a long ride in the saddle.</p>
<p><a href="recipes/cali-common" >California Common</a> - This California Common is another beer that is in my regular rotation.</p>
<p><a href="recipes/rhubarb-wheat" >Rhubarb Wheat</a> - This wheat is a standard wheat beer but with tartness from the rhubarb. It&rsquo;s kind of like drinking a sour beer without going through the process to brew one.</p>
