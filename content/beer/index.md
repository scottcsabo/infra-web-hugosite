I've been brewing my own beer and mead for almost 15 years now. It has been a really enjoyable hobby and one that allows me to show a bit of my creative side. Here are a few of the recipes that I have devised and brewed over the years - a nice variety of common styles and some really out there ideas and flavors. All recipes are for a 5 gallon batch size.

[Hot Pants](recipes/hot-pants-jalapeno-pepper) - A pale ale made with jalapeno peppers and cilantro!

[Czech Pilsner](recipes/czech-pilsner) - A traditional Czech Pislner, brewed the traditional way, with multiple decoctions.

[Prickly Pear Sour](recipes/prickly-pear-sour) - A refreshing sour with the wonderful taste of prickly pear fruit. The color on this one is amazing!

[Porter](recipes/porter) - A really solid porter and one that takes additional flavor profiles on well such as vanilla, chocolate, or peanut butter.

[Peanut Butter Jelly Time!](recipes/peanut-butter-jelly-time) - I'll admit that this one is a bit out there! I wanted a beer that reminded me of my favorite sandwich and came up with this. Reviews have been understandably mixed - people either really love it or they really hate it. 

[Gose](recipes/gose) - A solid Gose recipe that is easy to tweak to your desired sour and saltiness.

[Dark Czech Pilsner](recipes/dark-czech-pilsner) - A traditional Dark Czech Pislner, brewed the traditional way, with multiple decoctions. This is one of my absolute favorites!

[Brown Ale](recipes/brown) - This brown ale is part of my regular rotation and is absolute crowd pleaser!
