I have a passion for the great outdoors. I love going on adventures either by foot or on my beloved mountain bike. Being in nature helps me feel more connected to myself and the world around me and acts as a wonderful stress reliever. 

I have had the opportunity to explore some truly remarkable places and have included a small collection of my photos from various adventures in the wild.
